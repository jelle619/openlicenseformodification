# Open License for Modification (OLM)
Open License for Modification - a license for the innovators among us.

# Get started
It's easy - copy the License.txt and include it in your project. You may also include the contents of License.txt in an existing file, but this is discouraged.

Then, change the copyright/licensor information, and ONLY this information, to suit your project.

# What sets this license apart from others?
The Open License for Modification is unlike any other license. It allows people to copy your project for personal use, but may not distribute it without editing the original object. This can come in handy for a multitude of instances.

Let's say you have a website with it's source published on GitHub so other people can use your site as a template. However, you don't want them to copy the site exactly - text and all - and publish it under their own domain name.

This is where the Open License for Modification comes in. It inspires innovation and creativity, yet protects the licensor from someone exactly copying all the hard work you have done and perhaps distribute it as their own.

The license won't be a good fit for every project, and it was never meant to be a good fit for every project. Some projects simply require the user to redistrubete the exact same object - in some way or another - to be properly used as it was meant to be. But for the projects that don't require this, please consider using OLM as your license.

# I would like to make some changes
Please let us know in the 'Issues' section of this project which changes you want to see in future revisions of the license. If you would like to make changes to the OLM license just for your own project, please don't use 'OLM' or Open License for Modification' in the title of your license and mention it's a modified version of the Open License for Modification license.

# Special thanks
This license is based of MysteryDash's work on the Simple-Non-Code-License which can be found at https://github.com/MysteryDash/Simple-Non-Code-License
